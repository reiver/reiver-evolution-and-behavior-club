§§ Reading Group Format

The format of the **Evolution And Behavior Club** reading groups was —

• a new book or scholarly paper (almost always on the topic of evolution and behavior) was nominated by members of the reading-group who regularly attended,
• the nominaion inluded a pitch (by the nominator) for why others should vote for the book or scholarly paper they nominated,
• regular members of the reading-group then voted for nominationed books or scholarly papers — each person usually was allowed to vote for 2 or 3 nominations (depending on how many nominations there were),
• an organizer (who was managing the vote) counted the votes, and sent the results to everyone (usually via an **e-mail mailing list**) — including which nomination was the winner,
• the members of the reading-ground then usually spend a number of months reading and discussing book or scholarly paper than won the nomination — the reading-groups strived for deep understandings (rather than breadth with shallow understandings),
• the members of the reading list would meet once every 1 week, or once every 2 weeks, or once every month — it varied from reading-group to reading-group, and over the years,
• everyone was expected to do the reading themselves, but — one person (who changed each meet-up) was assigned the task of summarizing the readings, giving a presentation on it, and facilitating the discuss,
• also, after a reading-group meet-up, many (if not most) of the attendees spend the next few hours, if the most of the rest of the day, socializing a near by coffee-shops and restaurants.

§§ Christmas Parties

**Christmas parties** for the **Evolution And Behavior Club** often took place at the home of Patricia Veinott and Dan Kim (who are wife and husband).
