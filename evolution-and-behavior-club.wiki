§ Evolution And Behavior Club

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

The **Evolution And Behavior Club** was a club that existed from the year 2013 to the year 2020, with most meetings happening //in person// mostly in downtown Vancouver.
One of the main components of the **Evolution And Behavior Club** was a number of //reading-groups// that focused on reading and discussing books and scholarly papers on **evolution** and **behavior** (and in particular **human behavior**).

§§ Core Members

The core members of the **Evolution And Behavior Club** (in alphabetical order) were:

• Charles Iliya Krempeaux,
• Michael McConkey,
• Patricia Veinott (who goes by “Trish”).

§§ Members

Other people came and went over the years.
Some of these members of the **Evolution And Behavior Club** (in alphabetical order) include:

• Al Piran,
• Dan Kim (who is Patricia Veinott's husband),
• David Edward Clark,
• Frank Kassanits,
• Hirad Motamed,
• Hyerim Kang (who goes by “Bella”, and who eventually became Charles Iliya Krempeaux's wife),
• Jerram Ritchie,
• Kalim Kassam,
• Matt Emery,
• Oliver Hung,
• Sigal Blay,
• //and many others//.

§§ Reading Group Format

The format of the **Evolution And Behavior Club** reading groups was —

• a new book or scholarly paper (almost always on the topic of evolution and behavior) was nominated by members of the reading-group who regularly attended,
• the nominaion inluded a pitch (by the nominator) for why others should vote for the book or scholarly paper they nominated,
• regular members of the reading-group then voted for nominationed books or scholarly papers — each person usually was allowed to vote for 2 or 3 nominations (depending on how many nominations there were),
• an organizer (who was managing the vote) counted the votes, and sent the results to everyone (usually via an **e-mail mailing list**) — including which nomination was the winner,
• the members of the reading-ground then usually spend a number of months reading and discussing book or scholarly paper than won the nomination — the reading-groups strived for deep understandings (rather than breadth with shallow understandings),
• the members of the reading list would meet once every 1 week, or once every 2 weeks, or once every month — it varied from reading-group to reading-group, and over the years,
• everyone was expected to do the reading themselves, but — one person (who changed each meet-up) was assigned the task of summarizing the readings, giving a presentation on it, and facilitating the discuss,
• also, after a reading-group meet-up, many (if not most) of the attendees spend the next few hours, if the most of the rest of the day, socializing a near by coffee-shops and restaurants.

§§ Other Readings

A number of us also did a lot of readings on **evolution** and **behavior** outside the **Evolution And Behavior Club**.
So the readings list represents things we read and discussed together — as a group.

But our collective knowleddge went much beyond those readings.
And many of our discussions brough in that outside knowledge.

§§ Locations

At the beginning of the **Evolution And Behavior Club** and for many years, the //main// reading-group meet-ups were held at a location that was both an //art gallery// and a //coffee shop// in downtown Vancouver called **The Buzz Cafe & Espresso Bar** that was housed inside of **Harrison Galleries**.
It was at //901 Homer Street, Vancouver// — at the intersection of //Homer Street// and //Smithe Street//.
**The Buzz** eventually closed down, and we later had a find a new location.

After the **The Buzz** closed, one of the places the //main// reading-group ended up at was //Lost + Found Cafe//.
It was at //33 West Hastings Street, Vancouver// — on //West Hastings Street// between //Abbott Street// and //Carall Street//.
The **Lost + Found" (pronounced //“lost and found”//) closed, assumingly, as a result of the reaction to the [[covid-19-lockdown]].

One of the non-//main// reading-groups that was part of the **Evolution And Behavior Club** was held at the **Waves Coffee House** at //#100 - 900 Howe Street, Vancouver// — the //Waves Coffee// on //Howe Street// between //Smithe Street// and //Nelson Street//.
I.e., the //Waves Coffee// that had inside of it the world's first [[bitcoin]] ATM.

Another of the non-//main// reading-groups that was part of the **Evolution And Behavior Club** was held at or just outside one of the coffee-shops at the **Vancouver Public Library** (**VPL**) at //350 West Georgia Street, Vancouver// — i.e., the large very distictive looking building between //Robson Street// and //West Georgia Street//, as well as between //Homer Street// and //Hamilton Street//.

§§ Christmas Parties

**Christmas parties** for the **Evolution And Behavior Club** often took place at the home of Patricia Veinott and Dan Kim (who are wife and husband).
